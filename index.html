  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I've always been drawn to solving problems‚Äîwhether it's debugging code, designing hardware, or helping people figure out their next step. That curiosity led me to study Computer Science at the University at Buffalo, where I‚Äôve built everything from AI-powered apps to Arduino-based systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside the classroom, I‚Äôve led Agile teams of 5 to 17 people, mentored new students as a Peer Coordinator, and worked on projects that merge software, design, and real-world impact‚Äîfrom music-based recommendation engines to autonomous robots that clean up their environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it‚Äôs building scalable web apps or collaborating on CAD-based hardware, I care about thoughtful design, accessibility, and making things that genuinely help people.

      <h3>Autonomous Trash Collecting Robot</h3>
      <p>
        As Project Manager for an interdisciplinary engineering team at Theta Tau, I led the design and implementation of an Arduino-based autonomous trash-collecting robot. The system featured a front-loading scoop mechanism and ultrasonic sensors to detect and retrieve waste. My responsibilities included CAD design oversight, sensor calibration, task delegation, and iterative testing to ensure smooth mechanical and software integration.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Deliverables</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>‚úÖ Led a 17-member Agile team using weekly standups, sprint planning, and Trello boards</li>
        <li>üìê Designed the chassis and mechanical scoop in CAD for fabrication via 3D printing</li>
        <li>ü§ñ Programmed the robot to autonomously detect and collect small trash items using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors</li>
        <li>üöÄ Ensured on-time delivery of all milestones within budget constraints</li>
      </ul>
