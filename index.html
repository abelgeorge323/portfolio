      <p>
        I've always been drawn to solving problems—whether it's debugging code, designing hardware, or helping people figure out their next step. That curiosity led me to study Computer Science at the University at Buffalo, where I’ve built everything from AI-powered apps to Arduino-based systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the classroom, I’ve led Agile teams of 5 to 17 people, mentored new students as a Peer Coordinator, and worked on projects that merge software, design, and real-world impact—from music-based recommendation engines to autonomous robots that clean up their environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s building scalable web apps or collaborating on CAD-based hardware, I care about thoughtful design, accessibility, and making things that genuinely help people.

      <h3>Social Sync App – Personality-Based Event Matching</h3>
      <p>
        Originally developed as a class project, Social Sync began as a personality-based roommate matcher using Big Five trait data from Kaggle. Over time, it evolved into a broader platform to connect people through event recommendations based on psychological clustering.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Deliverables</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>🧠 Conducted clustering analysis on over 10,000 responses to Big Five surveys using KMeans and the Elbow Method</li>
        <li>📊 Identified distinct personality clusters and designed user personas for matching algorithms</li>
        <li>🧩 Developed a React front-end and Python backend to serve personalized event recommendations</li>
        <li>📈 Visualized trait distributions and cluster metrics to guide product evolution</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Autonomous Trash Collecting Robot</h3>
      <p>
        As Project Manager for an interdisciplinary engineering team at Theta Tau, I led the design and implementation of an Arduino-based autonomous trash-collecting robot. The system featured a front-loading scoop mechanism and ultrasonic sensors to detect and retrieve waste. My responsibilities included CAD design oversight, sensor calibration, task delegation, and iterative testing to ensure smooth mechanical and software integration.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Deliverables</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Led a 17-member Agile team using weekly standups, sprint planning, and Trello boards</li>
        <li>📐 Designed the chassis and mechanical scoop in CAD for fabrication via 3D printing</li>
        <li>🤖 Programmed the robot to autonomously detect and collect small trash items using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors</li>
        <li>🚀 Ensured on-time delivery of all milestones within budget constraints</li>
      </ul>
